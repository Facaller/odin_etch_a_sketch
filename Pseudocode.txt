***** Revised pseudocode *****

Create a const value for grid size, rows, and columns (use #ID)
Set dimensions to grid size value (in px)
Create for loop with row times column values (try nested loop for experimentation)
Let loop create div for cells (try 2 seperate divs [rows; columns] and single div [cells])
Set div(s) dimensions to equal container divided by rows/columns (in px)
Add classes where necessary and append children as needed.

Create button element in JS
Add event listener to button for mouse click
After click, prompt user for number less than 100
Old grid is replaced by new grid with new number of cells
