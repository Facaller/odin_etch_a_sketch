Figure out how to create div rows and columns (google says loops) --- DONE

Use flex to line them up in grid format and give them a border
    Give each div a square border
    Give container a clear border 
    Use flex to adjust size for divs to fit container


Create a hover effect for each grid block using event listeners
Use JS to create hover effect and change the colour
--Re-evaluate at this point --
