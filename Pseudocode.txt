Figure out how to create div rows and columns (google says loops) --- DONE

Use flex to line them up in grid format and give them a border
    Give each div a square border
    Give container a clear border 
    Use flex to adjust size for divs to fit container

Create a hover effect for each grid block using event listeners
    Activate with click then begin background colour div change
    Try mouseover without mouseout
    Add new class to accomodate black and rainbow
